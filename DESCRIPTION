Description: Estimates and plots confounder-adjusted survival curves using either 'Direct Adjustment', 'Direct Adjustment with Pseudo-Values', various forms of 'Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting', two forms of 'Augmented Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting',
 'Empirical Likelihood Estimation' and 'Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation'. Also includes a significance test for the equality of two adjusted survival curves and the calculation of adjusted restricted mean survival times.
 Additionally enables the user to estimate and plot cause-specific confounder-adjusted cumulative incidence functions in the competing risks setting using the same methods (with some exceptions).

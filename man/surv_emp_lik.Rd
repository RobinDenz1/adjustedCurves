\title{
Empirical Likelihood Estimation Survival Curves
}
\description{

This page explains the details of estimating adjusted survival curves using the empirical likelihood estimation methodology introduced by Wang et al. (2019) for single event time-to-event data (\code{method="emp_lik"} in the \code{\link[=adjustedsurv]{adjustedsurv}} function). All regular arguments of the \code{adjustedsurv} function can be used. Additionally, the \code{treatment_vars} argument has to be specified in the \code{adjustedsurv} call. Further arguments specific to this method are listed below.

}

\arguments{
  \item{treatment_vars}{
[\strong{required}] A character vector of column names specifying variables to be used as covariates in the empirical likelihood estimation. See details and examples.
}
  \item{moment}{
A character string specifying which moment to adjust for. Can be either \code{"first"} (default) or \code{"second"}.
}
  \item{standardize}{
A logical variable indicating whether the \code{treatment_vars} variables should be standardized. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See details.
}
  \item{gtol}{
A number specifying the tolerance for the weights. Is basically only used to avoid division by 0 errors in cases where the weights are estimated to be 0. Defaults to 0.00001.
}
  \item{max_iter}{
Maximum number of iterations allowed in the newton-raphson algorithm. Set to 100 by default which is more than enough in most cases.
}
  \item{newton_tol}{
Tolerance used in the newton-raphson algorithm. Set to 1.0e-06 by default which is more than enough in most cases.
}

\itemize{
\item{\strong{Type of Adjustment:} Requires a character vector of variable names used to balance the distribution of covariates (treatment assignment mechanism)}
\item{\strong{Doubly-Robust:} Estimates are not Doubly-Robust (see details).}
\item{\strong{Categorical groups:} Only binary treatments are allowed. The column specified by \code{variable} must be a factor variable with exactly two levels.}
\item{\strong{Approximate Variance:} Calculations to approximate the variance and confidence intervals are not available. Bootstrapping can still be used to estimate the confidence intervals (see \code{?adjustedsurv}).}
\item{\strong{Allowed Time Values:} Allows both continuous and integer survival times.}
\item{\strong{Bounded Estimates:} Estimates are guaranteed to be bounded in the 0 to 1 probability range.}
\item{\strong{Monotone Function:} Estimates are guaranteed to be monotone.}
\item{\strong{Dependencies:} This method relies on the \pkg{MASS} package. While code from the \pkg{adjKMtest} package is used internally (see <https://github.com/kimihua1995/adjKMtest>) it is not necessary to install this package. The code is directly included in this R-Package. If you use this method, please cite the paper by Wang et al. (2019).}
}

A non-parametric likelihood based method which does not require the researcher to assume that the data was generated by any known family of distributions. This method works by forcing the moments of the covariates to be equal between treatment groups, through the maximization of a constrained likelihood function. The resulting equality of the distributions removes the bias created by the confounders. This method was proposed by Wang et al. (2019). Since the exact form of both mechanisms are left unspecified, it is more robust to model misspecification than IPTW or direct adjustment.

The underlying method is theoretically doubly-robust as shown by Wang et al. (2019), but the specific implementation of this method implemented in this package is not as demonstrated in Denz et al. (2022). For example, if some confounder has a quadratic effect on the treatment-assignment but it is only passed to this function as a linear predictor (e.g. without squaring it) this method will produce asymptotically biased estimates.

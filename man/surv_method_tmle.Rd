\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A \code{data.frame} object containing the needed time-to-event data in standard format.
  }
  \item{variable}{
A character string specifying the variable by which the survival curves should be grouped. Must be a valid columname of \code{data}.
  }
  \item{ev_time}{
A character string specifying the variable indicating the time-to-event or time-to-censoring. Must be a valid columname of \code{data}.
  }
  \item{event}{
A character string specifying the binary event indicator. Must be a valid columname of \code{data}.
  }
  \item{method}{
A character string specifying the adjustment method to use. See details.
  }
  \item{sd}{
A logical variable, indicating whether the standard deviation of the survival probabilities should be calculated. Needed to calculate confidence intervals.
  }
  \item{times}{
A numeric vector of time points at which the survival probability should be estimated or \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL} the survival is estimated at all points in time at which an event occured. Only relevant for some methods, ignored otherwise. See details.
  }
  \item{t_max}{
The furthest point in time to consider in the survival curve estimation. See \code{survtmle}.
  }
  \item{adjust_vars}{
A character vector of column names specifying variables to be used when modeling the outcome, treatment and censoring mechanism. See details and examples.
  }
  \item{SL.ftime}{
A character vector or list specification to be passed to the \code{SL.library} option in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the outcome regression. See\code{?SuperLearner} for more information on how to specify valid \code{SuperLearner} libraries. It is expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input variables, which will be called "trt", \code{names(adjust_vars)}, and "t".
  }
  \item{SL.ctime}{
A character vector or list specification to be passed to the \code{SL.library} argument in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the estimate of the conditional hazard for censoring. It is expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input variables, which will be called "trt" and \code{names(adjust_vars)}.
  }
  \item{SL.trt}{
A character vector or list specification to be passed to the \code{SL.library} argument in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the estimate of the conditional probability oftreatment. It is expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input variables, which will be \code{names(adjust_vars)}.
  }
  \item{glm.ftime}{
A character specification of the right-hand side of the equation passed to the \code{formula} option of a call to \code{glm} for the outcome regression. Ignored if \code{SL.ftime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use "trt" to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula can additionally include any variables found in \code{names(adjust_vars)}.
  }
  \item{glm.ctime}{
A character specification of the right-hand side of the equation passed to the \code{formula} option of a call to \code{glm} for the estimate of the conditional hazard for censoring.  Ignored if \code{SL.ctime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use "trt" to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples).  The formula can additionally include any variables found in \code{names(adjust_vars)}.
  }
  \item{glm.trt}{
A character specification of the right-hand side of the equation passed to the \code{formula} option of a call to \code{glm} for the estimate of the conditional probability of treatment. Ignored if \code{SL.trt} is not equal to \code{NULL}. The formula can include any variables found in \code{names(adjust_vars)}.
  }
  \item{...}{
Additional arguments passed to \code{survtmle}.
  }

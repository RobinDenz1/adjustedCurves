\title{
Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted Survival Estimates using Pseudo-Values
}
\description{

This page explains the details of estimating inverse probability of treatment weighted survival curves using Pseudo-Values for single event time-to-event data. The function is called internally when using \code{method="iptw_pseudo"} in the \code{\link[=adjustedsurv]{adjustedsurv}} function.

This method works by modelling the treatment assignment mechanism. The individual observations are weighted using inverse probability of treatment weights or other balancing weights (see details) and pseudo-values. If the model is correctly specified, unbiased results will be obtained. The main difference to the \code{\link[=surv_iptw_cox]{iptw_cox}} and \code{\link[=surv_iptw_cox]{iptw_km}} functions is the use of pseudo-values.

\usage{
surv_iptw_pseudo(data, variable, ev_time, event, conf_int,
                 conf_level=0.95, times, treatment_model,
                 weight_method="ps", stabilize=TRUE,
                 trim=FALSE, se_method="cochrane",
                 censoring_vars=NULL, ipcw_method="binder",
                 ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A \code{data.frame} object containing the needed time-to-event data in standard format.
}
  \item{variable}{
A character string specifying the variable by which the survival curves should be grouped. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}. The variable specified should be a factor variable.
}
  \item{ev_time}{
A character string specifying the variable indicating the time-to-event or time-to-censoring. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}.
}
  \item{event}{
A character string specifying the binary event indicator. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}.
}
  \item{conf_int}{
A logical variable, indicating whether the asymptotic variances and confidence intervals of the survival probabilities should be calculated.
  }
  \item{conf_level}{
A number specifying the confidence level of asymptotic confidence intervals.
  }
  \item{times}{
A numeric vector of time points at which the survival probability should be estimated.
}
  \item{treatment_model}{
Must be either a model object with \code{variable} as response variable, a vector of weights or a formula which can be passed to \code{WeightIt}.
}
  \item{weight_method}{
Method used in \code{WeightIt} function call. Ignored if \code{treatment_model} is not a formula object.
}
  \item{stabilize}{
Whether to stabilize the weights or not. Is set to \code{TRUE} by default. Stabilizing has no effect on the estimates, only on the asymptotic variance calculations and confidence intervals. Without stabilizing, those estimates are biased downward.
  }
  \item{trim}{
Can be either \code{FALSE} (default) or a numeric value at which to trim the weights. If \code{FALSE}, weights are used as calculated or supplied. If a numeric value is supplied, all weights that are bigger than \code{trim} are set to \code{trim} before the analysis is carried out. Useful when some weights are extremely large.
  }
  \item{se_method}{
One of \code{"miller"}, \code{"galloway"}, \code{"cochrane"} and \code{"simple"}. Specifies which kind of standard error to calculate. Defaults to \code{"cochrane"}. See details.
}
  \item{censoring_vars}{
An optional character vector specifying variables in \code{data}. Those are used in the calculation of inverse probability of censoring weighted pseudo observations. See \code{?pseudo_aareg} for more information. Set to \code{NULL} (default) to use standard pseudo-values without corrections for dependent censoring instead.
}
  \item{ipcw_method}{
The specific method used in the calculation of inverse probability of censoring weighted pseudo observations. Can be either \code{"binder"} (default) or \code{"hajek"}. See \code{?pseudo_aareg} for more information. Ignored if \code{censoring_vars=NULL}.
}
  \item{...}{
Further arguments passed to \code{WeightIt}.

\itemize{
\item{\strong{Type of Adjustment:} Requires a model describing the treatment assignment mechanism. This must be either a \code{\link{glm}} or \code{\link{multinom}} object.}
\item{\strong{Doubly-Robust:} Estimates are not Doubly-Robust.}
\item{\strong{Categorical groups:} Any number of levels in \code{variable} are allowed. Must be a factor variable.}
\item{\strong{Approximate Variance:} Calculations to approximate the variance and confidence intervals are available.}
\item{\strong{Allowed Time Values:} Allows both continuous and integer time.}
\item{\strong{Bounded Estimates:} Estimates are not guaranteed to be bounded in the 0 to 1 probability range.}
\item{\strong{Monotone Function:} Estimates are not guaranteed to be monotone.}
\item{\strong{Dependencies:} This method relies on the \code{\link[prodlim]{prodlim}} package. The \code{WeightIt} package is also required if \code{treatment_model} is a formula object. Additionally requires the \code{eventglm} package if \code{censoring_vars} is specified.}

Adjusted survival curves are calculated by first estimating appropriate case-weights for each observation in \code{data}. This can be done using inverse probability of treatment weights using the propensity score (usually estimated using a logistic regression model) or by some other method (see \code{?weightit}). Pseudo-Values are then calculated for every observation in \code{data} at some points in time \eqn{T}. Since Pseudo-Values bypass the problem of censoring, a simple weighted average of the Pseudo-Values can be taken for every \eqn{T}. See Andersen et al. (2017) for more details on this method and Andersen and Perme (2010) for more information on Pseudo-Values in general.

The standard error of this estimator can be approximated by calculation a weighted version of the standard error estimator. Interestingly, no exact method exists in the weighted case. Four approximations are implemented which can be chosen using the \code{se_method} argument. The equations for \code{"miller"}, \code{"galloway"} and \code{"cochrane"} are described and compared in Gatz and Smith (1995). \code{"simple"} is just the standard equation with a weight term added and should only be used with stabilized weights (\code{stabilize=TRUE}). The resulting estimates are conservative in nature, because they ignore the variation introduced by the pseudo-value calculation (Zeng et al. 2021). It is generally recommended to use bootstrap estimates instead.

Additionally, covariate-dependent censoring can be corrected for using inverse probability of censoring weighted pseudo-values (Binder et al. 2014) instead of regular pseudo-values (specified using the \code{censoring_vars} and \code{ipcw_method} arguments).

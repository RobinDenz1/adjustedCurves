\title{
Estimate Confounder-Adjusted Restricted Mean Time Lost
}
\description{
This function can be utilized to estimate the confounder-adjusted restricted mean time lost (RMTL), possibly due to a specific cause, given previously estimated adjusted survival curves / CIFs created using the \code{\link{adjustedsurv}} or \code{\link{adjustedcif}} function.
}
\usage{
adjusted_rmtl(adj, to, from=0, conf_int=FALSE,
              conf_level=0.95, interpolation="steps",
              difference=FALSE, ratio=FALSE,
              group_1=NULL, group_2=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{adj}{
An \code{adjustedsurv} object created using the \code{adjustedsurv} function or a \code{adjustedcif} object created using the \code{adjustedcif} function.
  }
  \item{from}{
A number specifying the left side of the time interval of interest. See details. Usually this should be kept at 0 (default) to estimate the standard RMTL. Should only be changed if there are good reasons for it.
  }
  \item{to}{
A number specifying the right side of the time interval of interest. See details.
  }
  \item{conf_int}{
Whether bootstrap estimates should be used to estimate the standard errors and confidence intervals of the RMST estimates. Can only be used if \code{bootstrap=TRUE} was used in the \code{\link{adjustedsurv}} or \code{\link{adjustedcif}} call.
  }
  \item{conf_level}{
A number specifying the confidence level of the bootstrap confidence intervals.
  }
  \item{interpolation}{
Either \code{"steps"} (default) or \code{"linear"}. This parameter controls how interpolation is performed. If this argument is set to \code{"steps"}, the curves will be treated as step functions. If it is set to \code{"linear"}, the curves wil be treated as if there are straight lines between the point estimates instead. Points that lie between estimated points will be interpolated accordingly. Should usually be kept at \code{"steps"}. See Details.
  }
  \item{difference}{
Whether to estimate the difference between two adjusted RMTLs instead. When \code{conf_int=TRUE} is also specified, this function will also return the standard error of the difference, the associated confidence interval and a p-value. The p-value is the result of a one-sample t-test where the null-hypothesis is that the difference is equal to 0. To specify which difference should be estimated, the \code{group_1} and \code{group_2} arguments can be used. By default, the difference between the first and second level in \code{variable} is computed.
  }
  \item{ratio}{
Whether to estimate the ratio between two RMTLs instead. When \code{conf_int=TRUE} is also specified, this function will also return the associated confidence interval and a p-value. The p-value is the result of a one-sample t-test where the null-hypothesis is that the ratio is equal to 1. To specify which ratio should be calculated, the \code{group_1} and \code{group_2} arguments can be used. By default, the ratio between the first and second level in \code{variable} is computed. The confidence interval and test-statistic is estimated using the Fieller method.
  }
  \item{group_1}{
Optional argument to get a specific difference or ratio. This argument takes a single character string specifying one of the levels of the \code{variable} used in the original \code{adjustedsurv} or \code{adjustedcif} function call. This group will be subtracted from. For example if \code{group_1="A"} and \code{group_2="B"} and \code{difference=TRUE} the difference \code{A - B} will be used. If \code{NULL}, the order of the factor levels in the original \code{data} determines the order. Ignored if \code{difference=FALSE} and \code{ratio=FALSE}.
  }
  \item{group_2}{
Also a single character string specifying one of the levels of \code{variable}. This corresponds to the right side of the difference / ratio equation. See argument \code{group_2}. Ignored if \code{difference=FALSE} and \code{ratio=FALSE}.
  }
}
\details{

The cause-specific adjusted restricted mean time lost (RMTL) is calculated by integrating the estimated adjusted cause-specific CIF in a specified interval. Let \eqn{Z} be the grouping variable (corresponding to the \code{variable} argument in the \code{\link{adjustedcif}} function) with possible levels \eqn{Z \in \{0, 1, 2, ..., k\}}. \eqn{T} is defined as the time and \eqn{\hat{F}_z^d(t)} denotes the estimated counterfactual CIF for \code{cause} \eqn{d}. The RMTL is then defined as:

\deqn{RMTL_{z}^d(to) = \int_{from=0}^{to} \hat{F}_z^d(t)dt}

It can be interpreted as the mean time it takes an individual to succumb to the event of interest in group \eqn{Z = z} in the interval [0, \code{to}]. . More information on the method itself can be found in the references. Note however that simply subtracting the estimates from each other does not give a correct estimate of the area between the CIFs if the respective curves cross at some point. The \code{\link{adjusted_curve_test}} function can be used to calculate the actual area between the curves instead. See \code{?adjusted_curve_test} for more information.

If an \code{adjustedsurv} object is supplied in the \code{adj} argument, the CIF is calculated from the adjusted survival curves using the simple transformation: \eqn{\hat{F}_{z}(t) = 1 - \hat{S}_z(t)}. All further calculations are identical.

\strong{\emph{Confidence Intervals}}

If the \code{adj} object was created with \code{bootstrap=TRUE} in the corresponding function, bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors for the RMTLs can be approximated by setting \code{conf_int} to \code{TRUE}. If bootstrap samples occur where the CIF is not estimated up to \code{to}, the bootstrap sample is discarded and not used in further calculations. Approximate variance calculations not relying on the bootstrap estimates are currently not implemented. When using \code{difference=TRUE} the standard error of the difference between the two RMST values is approximated by \eqn{SE_{group_1 - group_2} = \sqrt{SE_{group_1}^2 + SE_{group_2}^2}}. When using \code{ratio=TRUE} the confidence intervals are calculated using the approximate formula given by Fieller (1954), assuming that the values are independent.

\strong{\emph{Multiple Imputation}}

If multiple imputation was used when creating the \code{adj} object, the analysis is carried out on all multiply imputed datasets and pooled using Rubins Rule. When bootstrapping was carried out as well, the pooled standard error over all imputed datasets is used in combination with the normal approximation to re-calculate the bootstrap confidence intervals.

\strong{\emph{Graphical Displays}}

A plot of the RMTL over time (with changing values for the \code{to} argument) can be produced using the \code{\link{plot_rmtl_curve}} function.

\strong{\emph{Computational Details}}

Instead of relying on numerical integration, this function uses exact calculations. This is achieved by using either step-function interpolation (\code{interpolation="steps"}, the default) or linear interpolation (\code{interpolation="linear"}). In the former case, the integral is simply the sum of the area of the squares defined by the step function. In the second case, the integral is simply the sum of the area of the rectangles. Either way, there is no need for approximations. In some situations (for example when using parametric models with \code{method="direct"}), the curves are not step functions. In this case the \code{interpolation} argument should be set to \code{"linear"}.

}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} containing the columns \code{group} (groups in \code{variable}) and \code{rmtl} (the estimated restricted mean time lost).

If \code{conf_int=TRUE} was used it additionally contains the columns \code{se} (the standard error of the restricted mean time lost), \code{ci_lower} (lower limit of the confidence interval), \code{ci_upper} (upper limit of the confidence interval) and \code{n_boot} (the actual number of bootstrap estimates used).

If \code{difference=TRUE} was used, it instead returns a \code{data.frame} that contains the columns \code{diff} (the difference between the RMTL values), \code{se} (the standard error of the difference), \code{ci_lower} (lower limit of the confidence interval), \code{ci_upper} (upper limit of the confidence interval) and \code{p_value} (the p-value of the one-sample t-test). The same results are presented when using \code{ratio=TRUE}, except that the \code{diff} column is named \code{ratio} and that there is no \code{se} column.

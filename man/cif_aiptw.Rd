\title{
Augmented Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted CIFs
}
\description{

This page explains the details of estimating augmented inverse probability of treatment weighted cumulative incidence functions for competing risks data. The function is called internally when using \code{method="aiptw"} in the \code{\link[=adjustedcif]{adjustedcif}} function. It is highly recommended to use \code{\link[=adjustedcif]{adjustedcif}} instead of calling this function directly.

When using \code{method="aiptw"} the \code{treatment_model} argument and the \code{outcome_model} argument have to be specified in the \code{adjustedcif} call.

}
\usage{
cif_aiptw(data, variable, ev_time, event, cause,
          conf_int, conf_level=0.95, times,
          outcome_model, treatment_model,
          censoring_model=NULL, verbose=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A \code{data.frame} object containing the needed time-to-event data in standard format.
}
  \item{variable}{
A character string specifying the variable by which the CIFs should be grouped. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}. The variable specified should be a factor variable.
}
  \item{ev_time}{
A character string specifying the variable indicating the time-to-event or time-to-censoring. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}.
}
  \item{event}{
A character string specifying the numeric event indicator. The censoring indicator should be coded as 0 and all other events of interest as 1, 2, etc. Must be a valid column name of \code{data}.
  }
  \item{cause}{
The cause of interest for which the cumulative incidence functions should be calculated. Should be a number that appears in the \code{event} column of \code{data}.
  }
  \item{conf_int}{
A logical variable, indicating whether the asymptotic variances and confidence intervals of the CIFs should be calculated.
  }
  \item{conf_level}{
A number specifying the confidence level of asymptotic confidence intervals.
  }
  \item{times}{
A numeric vector of time points at which the CIFs should be estimated.
}
  \item{outcome_model}{
Must be a \code{CauseSpecificCox} model object created using the \code{\link[riskRegression]{CSC}} function, modeling the time-to-event mechanism. See details and examples.
}
  \item{treatment_model}{
Must be a \code{glm} model object with \code{variable} as response variable. See details and examples.
}
  \item{censoring_model}{
Must be a \code{coxph} model object, modeling the censoring mechanism or \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL} (default) independent censoring is assumed. See details and examples.
}
  \item{verbose}{
Whether to print estimation information of the \code{ate} function in the \pkg{riskRegression} package.
}
  \item{...}{
Further arguments passed to \code{\link[riskRegression]{ate}}.
  }
}
\details{

\itemize{
\item{\strong{Type of Adjustment:} Requires both a treatment assignment model (\code{\link{glm}}) and a outcome model (\code{\link[riskRegression]{CSC}}). Also allows, but does not rely on, an additional model describing the censoring mechanism (a \code{\link{coxph}} object).}
\item{\strong{Doubly-Robust:} Estimates are Doubly-Robust.}
\item{\strong{Categorical groups:} Currently only two groups in \code{variable} are allowed. Must still be a factor variable.}
\item{\strong{Approximate Variance:} Calculations to approximate the variance and confidence intervals are available.}
\item{\strong{Allowed Time Values:} Allows both continuous and integer time.}
\item{\strong{Bounded Estimates:} Estimates are not guaranteed to be bounded in the 0 to 1 probability range.}
\item{\strong{Monotone Function:} Estimates are not guaranteed to be monotone.}
\item{\strong{Dependencies:} This method relies on the \pkg{riskRegression} package.}
}

Instead of only modeling the outcome mechanism or the treatment assignment mechanism, both kind of models are required to use this method. If either of those models are correctly specified, unbiased estimates will be obtained. Can also be used to adjust for dependent censoring using a Cox-Regression model. An obvious advantage of this method is it's doubly robust property. This however comes at the price of some efficiency. It is also possible that some estimates fall outside the 0 and 1 probability bounds, particularly if the time is near 0 or the maximal observed event time. There is also no guarantee that the estimated CIFs will be monotonically increasing. For more information on the methods the user is referred to the literature listed in the references.

This function is basically just a wrapper around the \code{\link[riskRegression]{ate}} function from the \pkg{riskRegression} package. Additional arguments may be passed to that function using the \code{...} syntax. It is however recommended to use \code{\link[riskRegression]{ate}} directly in these cases.

\value{
Returns a \code{list} object containing a \code{data.frame} with estimated CIFs for some points in time for each level of \code{variable} and the original object created using the \code{ate} function.

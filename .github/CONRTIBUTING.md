## How you can contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Share the love

Think `adjustedCurves` is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.

Using `adjustedCurves` for a paper you are writing? Consider citing it.

### Ask a question

Using `adjustedCurves` and got stuck? Browse the documentation and vignettes to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][mailto:email].

### Propose an idea

Have an idea for a new `adjustedCurves` feature? Take a look at the documentation and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a bug

Using `adjustedCurves` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

It is very important that a minimal reproducible example is included. Otherwise it will be very hard for us to fix the problem.

### Improve the documentation

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

### Contribute code

Care to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `adjustedCurves`? Awesome! Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.

## Development guidelines

Before submitting your own code it is recommended communicate with the package maintainer about your proposal. This can be done via github or via e-mail.

In general, we try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.

2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.
3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).
4. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).
